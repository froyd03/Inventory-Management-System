# Inventory Management System

## Overview  
An Inventory Management System (IMS) web application that allows users to track, manage, and maintain stock records, transactions, and product details. It provides a centralized interface for CRUD operations on items, categories, and inventory movements, making it easier to monitor stock levels, record purchases or sales, and generate basic reports.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- Node.js (version X or above)  
- npm / yarn  
- Database server (if using an external DB)  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/froyd03/Inventory-Management-System.git
   ```
2. Go into the project directory  
   ```bash
   cd Inventory-Management-System
   ```
3. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
   or  
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```  

### Database Setup  
1. Open the `database.sql` file and run it on your DB server to create the required tables and seed data.  
2. Adjust your DB connection settings (host, port, username, password) in the project’s config file (specify which file).  

### Running the App  
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you set) in your browser.  

If there’s also a backend server, run that similarly (e.g., `npm run start` in backend folder).  

---

## Usage  
Here are some example flows:  
- **Add a product**: Go to *Products* → *Add New*, fill in name, category, price, initial stock, save  
- **Adjust stock (stock in / stock out)**: Use *Inventory Transactions* form, specify product, quantity, type (in/out), and date  
- **View transaction history**: Navigate to *Transactions*, filter by date or product  

(You can include screenshots here if available.)
